SCORING BREAKDOWN:
==================
Title exact match:        1000 points
Title starts with:         500 points
Title whole word:          300 points
Title contains:            150 points

Keyword exact match:       400 points
Keyword starts with:       200 points
Keyword whole word:        100 points
Keyword contains:           50 points

Slug exact match:          250 points
Slug starts with:          120 points
Slug contains:              60 points

Category exact:             80 points
Category contains:          40 points

Description whole word:     30 points
Description contains:       15 points

Short title bonus:          20 points
Multi-word match bonus:    100 points (title) / 50 points (keywords)

EXAMPLES:
=========
Search "hr" → "HR & Staffing Services" scores 1000+ (exact keyword match + title contains)
Search "HR" → Same result (case-insensitive)
Search "data" → "Data Science" scores higher than others due to title position
Search "ai" → "Artificial Intelligence" scores highest, "Agentic AI" second
Search "cloud security" → Multi-word bonus ensures best matches come first
